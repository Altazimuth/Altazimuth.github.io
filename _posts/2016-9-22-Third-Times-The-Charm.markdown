title: Third Time's The Charm
---

I've decided to scale down and simplify things. I am now using [Jacob Tomlinson's](https://www.jacobtomlinson.co.uk/)
[Carte Noire](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/carte-noire) theme, which I have found a lot easier to modify to my own needs.

I've managed to get it such that any portfolio pages now display date ranges if an end date is specified, and even have the
correct grammar.
