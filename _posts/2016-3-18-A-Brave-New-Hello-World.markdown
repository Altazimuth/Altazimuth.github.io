title: A Brave New Hello World

After further research I decided that bootstrap would be a great nicety, and after issues with Jekyll Bootstrap
ended up finding [jaytch](https://github.com/groundh0g/jaytch), which is what this website is now using.
Many thanks to Joseph Hall ([groundh0g](https://github.com/groundh0g)) for his hard work on it.
On top of this I have Jekyll running locally so there should be a lot less extraneous commits to the
repository (though you can't see the previous commits in this repo because this repo is forked from a different
place).
